# Windows Internals Book 7th Edition Tools
The Windows Internals book, 7th edition Part 1, uses many tools to demonstrate various features of the Windows operating system. Most are from Sysinternals (http://www.sysinternals.com) and built-in tools. But some tools were written by Alex Ionescu and myself and used in the book; these are be published here with full source code.

Please note that these tools were NOT written by or endorsed by Microsoft. They are provided "as is" without any warranties or guarantees. For all I know, they might format your hard drive or even the entire World Wide Web. :) Use at your own risk!
